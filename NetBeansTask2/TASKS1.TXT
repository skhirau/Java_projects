1. display all num between 1 and 100 asc/desc  using while
   and do..while loop

2. all even between 1 and 100 asc/ desc.

3. all odd -----------------------------.

4. get one number from user and display the factorial of that number.
   5 :- 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

5. get one value from user and display the sum of all the numbers
   between 1 and that number.
   5 :-   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 =15.

6. get two numbers and display the first number raise to the power
   of second number.

   eg:- x=5 y=3
	5 raise to the powre 3 = 125
         
		 		 

7. get multi digits number from user and "display" the reverse of that number
   eg  (clue : use % )
   x     =  1234
   output:  4321
  
  
  
8. get one number from user and store the reverse of that number in
   another variable
   a=1234
   b=4321

9. get one number from user and display total number of even and odd digits
   in that given number
   a =12345
    even= 2
    odd = 3

10. get MULTI digits number from user and display as given
    suppose 6452 is taken in a variable

    a) 2546  (same as Q No. 7 )
    b) 2
       5
       4
       6
    c) TWO FIVE FOUR SIX
	
	d) TWO UNITS
	   FIVE TENS
	   FOUR HUNDREDS
	   SIX THOUSANDS
    
	e) SIX FOUR FIVE TWO
    
	f)       SIX THOUSANDS
		 FOUR HUNDREDS
		 FIVE TENS
		 TWO UNITS
	 

11. get one number form user and check that given number is prime or not.
     (a number which has exactly 2 factors is known as prime number.)

12. get one number from user and display the table of given number.

13. get one number from user and display all the numbers which fully divids
    the given number (show the factors of that number!)
    ex  20
    factors 1,2,4,5,10,20

13.1. FIND THAT GIVEN NUMBER IS PERFECT NUMBER OR NOT
      (PERFACT NUMBER :- (SUM OF ITS FACTOR - ITSELF) IS ITSELF
	6 :- 1 + 2 + 3 +6 -6 = 6
      )
	  
14. Get two numbers, one for numerator and the other for denominator,
    then simplify the given rational value.

ex  420 / 1760    will be  21/88
    


	
15. Get a multiple digits number from user and 
    repeatitive sum the digits until the sum is 
    a single digit value.
    (Cyclic sum upto single digit)
    67835    sum is 29   
	29 is multi digit number so add the digits again
	11    abhi bhi multi digit so
        2	

16. Get a number from user and show all PRIME factors (with its power);
    ex:
       20
       2 to the power 2
       5 to the power 1 	   
	
	

17. get a COUNT value from user and show FIRST count number 
    of PYTHAGORIAN TRIPLETS .
	(2m)^2  + (m^2 - 1)^2  =  (m^2 + 1)^2
	
	 

18. get a number from user and find that given number is perfact square number or not.
    (HINT : a perfact square is sum of first n odd numbers statring from 1,
	        if it is a perfact square then n will be its square root.) 	
	

19. Get two numbers from user and show the HCF of given numbers.
